//! Optimizer module role: admission leaf. Proven-case predicates behind the plan.
//!
//! The plan is built from two predicates only: the place's
//! declaration/type/proof evidence and the per-node admissibility that
//! resolves one membership observation's proven case. The independent
//! validator in `optimization-unit-semantics` re-derives the same predicates
//! from the candidate's rows rather than trusting this enumeration — a
//! matcher cannot attest to itself.
