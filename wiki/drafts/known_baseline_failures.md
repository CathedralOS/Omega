# Known baseline failures

Attribution evidence for test failures that reproduce at a recorded revision
without a task diff. A worker that hits one of these may cite this table —
command, revision, and failure set — instead of re-running a stash baseline.
Refresh or remove a row when its failures are fixed or when a task's diff could
plausibly interact with them; a listed failure does not excuse an unexplained
failure in affected behavior, and this file is not validation policy (see
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#validation-scope)).

Rows verified by independent stash-baseline reproduction at revision
`8220f55febc1` on 2026-09-13, macOS arm64, unless noted otherwise.

## typed-trees-to-checked-trees

`mbx nextest run -p typed-trees-to-checked-trees` — 3612/3624 pass; 12 fail in
boundary, attached-frame, borrow, terminal-unit, and contract test areas
unreachable from the `src/flow/` modules and the additive `product_pruning`
module. Sampled members (`erased_record_equality…`,
`discarded_calls_in_open_templates…`,
`accepts_static_persistent_copy_across…`) reproduce identically with the diff
stashed. Independently verified twice on this revision.

## compiler build-target activation

`mbx nextest run -p compiler --test build_target_activation` — 49/51 pass; 2
fail:
`x86_feature_admission::source_fma_then_attached_unit_call_stays_inside_one_canonical_mxcsr_envelope`
and
`x86_feature_admission::terminal_product_retains_exact_fma_operation_plan_and_x86_admission`,
both with `native artifact native instruction selection failed: FMA provider
transport is not implemented in the common instruction pipeline`. x86 FMA
provider transport is unimplemented; the failure is not host-specific.


## Host note (macOS)

`rust-objcopy` emits `dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libLLVM.dylib` (SIGABRT)
during test-binary linking on the pinned `nightly-2026-09-04` toolchain on
this host. It is a warning in build output only and does not fail compilation
or tests; do not investigate it as a test failure.

## Intel macOS host gap (x86_64-apple-darwin)

Environmental, not a test regression, verified across the macw3 wave on
2026-09-14 (independent sessions reproduced identical sets on unmodified
bases including `d1b7165cd6`, `07782416b4`, and `1055e88f31`):

- `TargetProfile::host()`
  (`omega-rust/omega/representations/target/src/lib.rs`, `host()`) has cfg
  arms for macos-aarch64, linux-aarch64, linux-x86_64, and windows-x86_64
  only, so host-profiled tests panic with `unsupported host profile for
  Omega native planning`. Observed sets: ~20 `package-manager` ops tests and
  2 `compiler::request` tests in the workspace `--lib` run.
- `native_hosted_target()` in `compiler/tests/canary_suite.rs` has the same
  four cfg arms, so `mbx nextest run -p compiler --test canary_suite` does
  not compile on this host.

On this host, route `omega` invocations through an explicit `--target` (for
example `linux_x86_64`) and report native-host coverage as unavailable rather
than re-running the baseline; a `MacosX64` host profile is open board work,
not a fix to inline into a task.
