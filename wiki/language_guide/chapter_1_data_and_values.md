# Chapter 1: Data And Values

Omega starts with explicit data shapes and explicit values.

`data` declarations describe stored state. Fields inside `data` are owned by
that value by default; there is no separate `owns` keyword for ordinary stored
fields.

```omega
data Player {
    name: String;
    health: i32;
    armor: i32;
}
```

Machines describe behavior over data. A machine receives access to data through
its signature.

```omega
machine Player::take_damage(
    &mut self,
    amount: i32
) {
    self.health = self.health - amount;
}
```

Working interpretation:

- `data` owns its fields.
- Machines do not implicitly own fields.
- A machine can mutate receiver state through `&mut self`.
- A machine can read receiver state through `&self`.
- Other inputs arrive as explicit parameters.
- Locals are temporary values inside a machine or state body.
- Mutation should be visible through `&mut` parameters or `self.` field access.

The `self.` prefix is intentionally visible. It lets a reader distinguish stored
state from locals and parameters at a glance.

## Locals

Locals are values introduced inside executable machine/state bodies.

```omega
machine Player::heal(
    &mut self,
    amount: i32
) {
    let next_health: i32 = self.health + amount;
    self.health = next_health;
}
```

Locals are not data fields. They do not become part of the data layout and they
do not survive outside the graph paths where their lifetime is valid.

## Parameters

Parameters are explicit entry values.

```omega
machine Combat::strike(
    attacker: &Player,
    defender: &mut Player,
    damage: i32
) {
    defender.health = defender.health - damage + attacker.armor;
}
```

Working interpretation:

- `attacker` is a shared borrow.
- `defender` is a unique mutable borrow.
- `damage` is a value parameter.
- Nothing is implicitly captured from ambient process state.

## Stored Values And Proof Facts

Stored fields may eventually carry proof-visible constraints, but constraints
are not part of Chapter 1's core model.

```omega
data Player {
    health: i32[range<0, 100>];
}
```

That syntax means `health` is still represented as an `i32`, with additional
proof obligations attached to assignments and transitions that can change it.
The constraint story is covered later in the invariants/proof chapters.

## Foundation

The foundation is:

- Data shape is explicit.
- Behavior is explicit.
- Access is explicit.
- There is no hidden machine-owned field declaration syntax.
- There is no implied stack magic behind state transitions.

Later chapters build on this by adding states, transitions, typed returns,
constraints, domains, invariants, traits, and runtime dispatch.
