# Owner Questions

Only unresolved owner-level language or architecture decisions belong here.
Settled decisions live in the language guide and design briefs; implementation
and deliberately deferred research live in `TASKS.md`. Questions are numbered
consecutively; pruning or adding one requires updating every repository
reference in the same change.

Question numbers are mutable queue positions, not permanent decision identities.
Code, canaries, and settled documentation must cite a stable named decision or
the governing guide section rather than an owner-question number. A settled
decision's durable identity does not change when this queue is pruned.

Before a proposed surface becomes an owner question, audit whether it is
implemented, whether any authored source uses it, and whether ordinary Omega
already expresses the customer. An unimplemented, unused spelling that adds no
capability beyond existing checked machines is retired rather than redesigned.
Hypothetical future utility does not by itself preserve syntax; a concrete
customer requiring a distinct capability may propose a new surface later.

Every `OWNER-BLOCKED` escalation must name an independently motivated product
requirement or credible external use case. Existing corpus use is not required.
A test, experiment, benchmark, or implementation task cannot be the sole
motivation, and machinery introduced only to support such work is removed or
kept non-authoritative rather than promoted into an owner decision.

Apply the same test to security machinery. Omega owns only claims it can
enforce at its actual compiler, package, and artifact boundaries. A proposal
that merely restates host operating-system, credential, transport, or operator
trust must be deleted or delegated to that owner rather than dressed as an
Omega guarantee. If the boundary or enforceable claim is genuinely ambiguous,
promote that narrow ambiguity here before adding machinery.

## Q1 — Own proof-only FloatMeaning equality and source correspondence

### Context

The Float catalog already defines exact binary32/binary64 meaning projection:
finite values map to nonzero rationals, signed zero and infinity remain
distinct, NaN payloads erase only in proof meaning, and cross-format projection
rejects. Checked and Terminal evidence retains exact projection invocations,
operators, operands, formats, equality coordinates, tables, and provenance.
The wider proof/`Real` connection now reaches the proof-kernel boundary rather
than lacking an executable Float model.

### Problem statement

The proof kernel accepts equality only over its existing scalar-term carrier;
it has no proof-only `FloatMeaning` or general `ProofValueId` term. Two
independently authored meaning projections also do not retain one shared
landed-source identity, while Terminal equality rows currently have neither an
exact contract owner nor an evidence-provenance lane that can authorize their
coalescing. Implementing any one of those choices privately would decide which
proof terms exist and when two authored projections denote the same value.

Choose together:

1. the kernel term that carries proof-only `FloatMeaning` values;
2. the accepted equality rule for that sum, including NaN-payload erasure and
   signed-zero distinction;
3. the exact source-coordinate identity and coalescing rule for independently
   authored projection invocations; and
4. the contract/evidence owner that Terminal replay must bind before such an
   equality can discharge an obligation.

### Proposed direction

Add a closed proof-only semantic-term carrier whose Float child is the existing
`FloatMeaning` sum, not a runtime scalar or tagged ABI. Bind every projection
term to the exact checked source value/projection occurrence and its canonical
Float table identity. Kernel equality compares the semantic sum structurally
under the documented payload erasure; coalescing is permitted only when the
retained landed-source identity and projection contract are identical.
Terminal evidence names that contract owner and source correspondence
explicitly, and the verifier independently reconstructs both before invoking
the equality rule.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: introduce a general proof-value term encompassing other
  proof-only sums, provided its equality rules are closed per carrier and do
  not create a runtime representation.
- Acceptable: avoid source-occurrence coalescing by retaining one explicit
  theorem/contract application that relates the two projections, provided its
  owner and complete evidence provenance survive Terminal replay.
- Tempting but wrong: encode `FloatMeaning` as a runtime scalar, compare raw
  float bits, or collapse signed zero merely because NaN payloads erase.
- Tempting but wrong: equate independently authored projections by matching
  operator names, format labels, compact fingerprints, or coincidentally equal
  values without a shared source/contract owner.

## Q2 — Complete the physical OCREQ/OCOUT v1 tables

### Context

D18 fixes the standalone Omega compiler's logical package subject, invocation,
build evaluation, generated-source custody, and publication model. D25 fixes
the eight-byte `OCREQ` identity, outer subject/invocation lengths and exact end,
the canonical facts each section must carry, the shared `OCOUT` header, and its
sole package/source-coordinate tail. `D` now validates that exact outer request
envelope without interpreting either inner section.

The landed ruling does not enumerate either section's byte order, row
envelopes and widths, numeric variant tags, reserved bytes, or the exact
subject-commitment domain and preimage. It likewise refers to edge-owned
`OCOUT` reason/resource/internal tables, phase order, and scalar provisions
without publishing them. The Rust request object is explicitly
nonauthoritative. Consequently the Delta-written and Omega-written compilers
can satisfy the prose while accepting incompatible byte streams or emitting
incompatible failures.

### Problem statement

Publish one complete version-1 physical profile covering:

1. the exact subject and invocation field order and every row envelope;
2. numeric tags and reserved-byte rules for source lineage, immutable
   resolution, package role, snapshot rows, products, targets, and admissions;
3. exact structural encodings for names, paths, revisions, identities, graph
   indices, dependency aliases, and the selected root;
4. the subject-commitment domain separator, preimage, and 32-byte digest
   placement;
5. closed `OCOUT` Reject, Incomplete, and InternalFailure code/coordinate
   tables plus fixed diagnostic phase precedence; and
6. every named request/compiler scalar provision that can produce
   `Incomplete(limit, requested)`.

### Proposed direction

Publish one normative `ocreq-v1` field table and adjacent closed `ocout-v1`
code/resource tables. Use explicit little-endian length-delimited rows and
zero-based validated graph indices; give every closed sum a fixed numeric tag
and zero reserved bytes. Domain-separate the commitment with a fixed literal
followed by the exact subject-section bytes, not a reconstructed object.
Represent each private capacity as one named scalar resource and order framing,
canonicality, graph, snapshot, admission, commitment, source, build, and later
compiler phases explicitly.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: split subject or invocation into independently versioned nested
  sections, provided the outer D25 exact-end frame remains unchanged and every
  nested identity and extent is canonical.
- Acceptable: choose a different structural identity or commitment preimage,
  provided both compilers can reconstruct it solely from the same request bytes
  and no host/Rust representation participates.
- Tempting but wrong: infer tags from Rust enum order, serialize the current
  Rust request, let `D` define one private layout and `C` another, or postpone
  reason/resource numbers until publication code happens to need them.

## Q3 — Give the complete Gamma compiler an explicit Beta call-row profile

### Context

D23 fixes the Alpha-written Beta compiler at 1,024 non-builtin procedure-call
references. The retained `gamma_compiler.beta` now consumes exactly 994 rows
before any production entry, total returned-`Bytes` preflight, publication
replay, or D19 adapter is added. An adjacent probe accepts thirty additional
calls and canonically refuses the thirty-first as
`Incomplete(call_rows, 1024, 1025)`.

This is the realistic next-rung compiler closure named by D12, not a synthetic
stress case. A straightforward allocation-ordered, cycle-rejecting and
DAG-sharing-aware `Bytes` preflight alone crosses the bound long before both
PC-zero adapters and their failure framing exist. Encoding that logic as an
opaque preassembled blob, host-generated table, or private higher-level
operation would evade rather than satisfy the direct Beta-to-Alpha edge.

### Problem statement

Choose one auditable way for the complete Beta-written Gamma compiler to fit:

1. revise the D23 Beta compiler's non-builtin call-row capacity and rebuild its
   exact artifact/admission subject;
2. retain 1,024 rows but require a specific source-level direct-emitter
   representation that materially reduces call references without introducing
   a hidden compiler stage or opaque generated program; or
3. replace another settled private Beta resource arrangement with an explicitly
   bounded profile that makes the same complete source admissible.

The ruling must keep Beta's language and Alpha's instruction set unchanged,
preserve canonical `Incomplete` behavior at the new adjacent bound, and leave
the Gamma compiler as ordinary audited Beta source.

### Proposed direction

Advance the private D23 call table from 1,024 to 2,048 rows, relocate its
adjacent compiler work tables coherently, and rebuild the Alpha-written Beta
compiler tape plus exact source/tape admission subject atomically. Keep every
other Beta language and compiler-boundary rule unchanged. Before ratification,
stage the complete Gamma adapter implementation against that candidate ceiling
and confirm an exact call count with useful headroom; if 2,048 is not enough,
select the smallest measured power-of-two profile that is.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: retain 1,024 after a measured, source-visible refactor of the
  direct emitter that leaves enough room for the complete adapters and remains
  simpler to audit than the present repeated calls.
- Acceptable: add a generic checked instruction-plan emitter owned entirely by
  `gamma_compiler.beta`, provided the plan is authored in Beta, validated by
  the existing direct-emitter/fixup substrate, and demonstrably reduces total
  source and proof complexity rather than hiding a bytecode blob.
- Tempting but wrong: raise the table silently, weaken total `Bytes` preflight,
  publish before validation, generate Beta source or Alpha bytes on the host,
  add an Alpha opcode, or treat the 1,024-row refusal as invalid Gamma source.

## Q4 — Total Delta entry-shape diagnostics

### Context

Delta v1 fixes the accepted headline shape: one `Console` boundary with four
specified callable signatures, a record `Main` with exactly one sealed
`console: Console` field plus ordinary program fields, and exactly
`machine Main::main(&mut self)` with no value parameters or return. D31 also
assigns every other authored `Console` type occurrence to `InvalidEntry` at the
type token.

The remaining entry judgment is not total. `LANGUAGE.md` anchors
`MissingEntry` at source extent, but does not say whether it means only absence
of the exact `Main::main` identity or also absence of `Main`, `Console`, or
`Main.console`. It assigns malformed, missing, duplicate, and “competing” entry
shapes to `InvalidEntry` without defining their complete candidate set or
coordinates. It also displays one exact boundary declaration without saying
whether member order and parameter binder spellings are semantic.

This matters because entry and ordinary body/control failures share the final
checking phase. The compiler must derive all candidates and choose the smallest
packed coordinate; it cannot promote whichever entry defect its traversal sees
first or use the DCOUT reason-code order to break a tie.

### Problem statement

Fix one complete entry-shape judgment covering:

1. the exact partition between `MissingEntry` and `InvalidEntry` for every
   absent, malformed, extra, or competing `Console`, `Main`, `Main.console`, and
   `Main::main` component;
2. the source coordinate for each authored defect and for each required but
   absent component;
3. deterministic priority when entry candidates coincide with one another or
   with ordinary body/control candidates; and
4. whether boundary-member order and parameter binder spellings participate in
   validity, or only member identity, positional parameter types, and return
   type do.

### Proposed direction

Treat boundary members as an unordered identity/signature set and parameter
binder spellings as nonsemantic. `MissingEntry` means only that no exact
`Main::main` machine identity was authored and is anchored at source extent. A
present `Main::main` with the wrong receiver, parameters, or return is an
`InvalidEntry` candidate at that machine declaration. Extra or malformed
authored boundary/Main components are `InvalidEntry` at the first byte of the
offending declaration, member, field, or type token. When the exact entry
machine exists but a required component is absent, use source extent for that
`InvalidEntry` candidate. Merge these with every body/control candidate solely
by packed coordinate; distinct reasons at one exact coordinate are an internal
contradiction unless this ruling assigns a specific structural suppression.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: require the displayed boundary member order or binder spellings,
  provided each mismatch and its exact coordinate are explicit and declaration
  packing order is not accidentally promoted into callable identity.
- Acceptable: reserve distinct synthetic coordinates for absent entry
  components, provided they are part of the Delta judgment and DCOUT coordinate
  contract rather than compiler-private sentinels.
- Tempting but wrong: let declaration traversal choose the first defect, use
  reason-code order to break ties, classify a malformed present entry as
  `MissingEntry`, or publish executable golden coordinates before the judgment
  is total.

## Q5 — Delete the provider-asserted indexed-application coverage scaffold

### Context

D29 requires every boundary-operator coverage row to come from a checked use's
ordered tagged application and an independently replayed selected realization.
The compiler now retains closed type/const applications with exact binder
coordinates, structural type custody, canonical const values, and declared
const carriers. Final symbolic substitution and role-specific realization
replay remain unfinished.

An older `omega-effects` subsystem instead models an indexed schema by a
display identity plus arity, models every concrete argument as a normalized
string, and lets a provider attach generic or exact asserted coverage. It adds
report fingerprints, closure/substitution machinery, selected-plan custody,
package-review projection, and a canonical review row that describes those
strings as applications “covered by a selected operator realization.” Its own
documentation concedes that it is non-authorizing pre-D29 scaffolding. The
closure function and every producer of asserted coverage are currently used
only by tests; production package review is a consumer waiting for rows that
no production compiler path issues.

### Problem statement

Decide whether this provider-authored coverage model has any independent
product requirement worth preserving after D29. As written, it cannot prove
its named claim: matching an asserted string tuple to a selected plan does not
establish binder category, exact type/const identity, checked realization,
admission, or executable coverage. Extending it alongside D29 would create two
application identities and invite the weaker one to be mistaken for security
evidence.

### Proposed solution

Delete the provider-asserted indexed-application coverage field and its
arity/string schema, concrete argument, substitution, closure, fingerprint,
provider-selection rejoin, and package-review “ExactApplications” surfaces.
Retain no compatibility row in canonical package evidence. Project
compiler-derived D29 applications as non-authorizing demand when that is useful
to final specialization, and introduce the word and type `coverage` only where
the compiler can also reconstruct the selected role-specific realization.
Generic provider-family package review remains fail-closed until that complete
join lands.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: keep a small explicitly demand-only substitution utility if a
  real final-composition customer exists, but use D29's tagged arguments and
  artifact-qualified binders; do not attach it to providers or canonicalize it
  as coverage.
- Acceptable: move an arity/string topology model entirely into test fixtures
  if tests still need malformed-order and substitution cases after production
  deletion.
- Tempting but wrong: preserve the subsystem because its hashes and rejection
  tests look security-sensitive, add a stronger digest around its strings, or
  compare provider assertions with compiler demand and rename equality
  “coverage.” None establishes that the selected realization implements the
  demanded application.

## Q6 — Total Delta receiver and callable ambiguity

### Context

Delta's grammar permits `&mut self` in the input list of both qualified and
unqualified machine declarations. A qualified data-owner machine gives `self`
an obvious nominal owner, but the contract assigns no type or storage owner to
`self` in an unqualified machine.

D22 also deliberately separates machine identity from data-member identity. A
sum case and qualified machine may therefore both have the spelling
`Owner::name`, and the shared postfix grammar can add the same argument list to
either. The contract says ambiguous state/callable continuation resolution
rejects, but does not total ordinary expression-call ambiguity or assign its
reason and coordinate.

### Problem statement

Fix the body-resolution judgment for:

1. `&mut self` on an unqualified machine, including the type of `self` if it is
   valid or the rejection reason and coordinate if it is not;
2. `Owner::name(...)` when exactly one constructor or qualified machine exists;
3. the same expression when both identities exist under D22's distinct
   namespaces; and
4. whether ordinary expression and transition-continuation ambiguity share one
   reason/anchor or remain context-specific.

### Proposed direction

Admit receivers only on uniquely resolved data-owner machines. Reject an
unqualified receiver as `TypeMismatch` at its authored `&`; a qualified unknown
owner remains `UnknownName` at the owner spelling. Preserve constructor and
machine lookup independently. When both exact callable identities match one
qualified expression, reject at the expression start: use `TypeMismatch` in an
ordinary value context and `InvalidControlTarget` in a transition continuation.
Do not use expected-result typing, arity, declaration order, or a preferred
namespace to choose one candidate.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: make an unqualified receiver a distinct explicit global-storage
  capability, provided its nominal type, initialization, aliasing, and lowering
  are specified rather than inferred from `Main`.
- Acceptable: reserve qualification syntactically for constructors or for
  machines and provide an unambiguous spelling for the other class, as an
  explicit Delta grammar revision.
- Tempting but wrong: let arity or expected return type select a candidate,
  choose constructors or machines by traversal order, silently treat
  unqualified `self` as `Main`, or collapse D22's namespaces inside one lookup
  table.
