# Owner Questions

Only unresolved owner-level language or architecture decisions belong here.
Settled decisions live in the language guide and design briefs; implementation
and deliberately deferred research live in `TASKS.md`. Questions are numbered
consecutively; pruning or adding one requires updating every repository
reference in the same change.

Question numbers are mutable queue positions, not permanent decision identities.
Code, canaries, and settled documentation must cite a stable named decision or
the governing guide section rather than an owner-question number. A settled
decision's durable identity does not change when this queue is pruned.

Before a proposed surface becomes an owner question, audit whether it is
implemented, whether any authored source uses it, and whether ordinary Omega
already expresses the customer. An unimplemented, unused spelling that adds no
capability beyond existing checked machines is retired rather than redesigned.
Hypothetical future utility does not by itself preserve syntax; a concrete
customer requiring a distinct capability may propose a new surface later.

Every `OWNER-BLOCKED` escalation must name an independently motivated product
requirement or credible external use case. Existing corpus use is not required.
A test, experiment, benchmark, or implementation task cannot be the sole
motivation, and machinery introduced only to support such work is removed or
kept non-authoritative rather than promoted into an owner decision.

Apply the same test to security machinery. Omega owns only claims it can
enforce at its actual compiler, package, and artifact boundaries. A proposal
that merely restates host operating-system, credential, transport, or operator
trust must be deleted or delegated to that owner rather than dressed as an
Omega guarantee. If the boundary or enforceable claim is genuinely ambiguous,
promote that narrow ambiguity here before adding machinery.

## Q1 — Own proof-only FloatMeaning equality and source correspondence

### Context

The Float catalog already defines exact binary32/binary64 meaning projection:
finite values map to nonzero rationals, signed zero and infinity remain
distinct, NaN payloads erase only in proof meaning, and cross-format projection
rejects. Checked and Terminal evidence retains exact projection invocations,
operators, operands, formats, equality coordinates, tables, and provenance.
The wider proof/`Real` connection now reaches the proof-kernel boundary rather
than lacking an executable Float model.

### Problem statement

The proof kernel accepts equality only over its existing scalar-term carrier;
it has no proof-only `FloatMeaning` or general `ProofValueId` term. Two
independently authored meaning projections also do not retain one shared
landed-source identity, while Terminal equality rows currently have neither an
exact contract owner nor an evidence-provenance lane that can authorize their
coalescing. Implementing any one of those choices privately would decide which
proof terms exist and when two authored projections denote the same value.

Choose together:

1. the kernel term that carries proof-only `FloatMeaning` values;
2. the accepted equality rule for that sum, including NaN-payload erasure and
   signed-zero distinction;
3. the exact source-coordinate identity and coalescing rule for independently
   authored projection invocations; and
4. the contract/evidence owner that Terminal replay must bind before such an
   equality can discharge an obligation.

### Proposed direction

Add a closed proof-only semantic-term carrier whose Float child is the existing
`FloatMeaning` sum, not a runtime scalar or tagged ABI. Bind every projection
term to the exact checked source value/projection occurrence and its canonical
Float table identity. Kernel equality compares the semantic sum structurally
under the documented payload erasure; coalescing is permitted only when the
retained landed-source identity and projection contract are identical.
Terminal evidence names that contract owner and source correspondence
explicitly, and the verifier independently reconstructs both before invoking
the equality rule.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: introduce a general proof-value term encompassing other
  proof-only sums, provided its equality rules are closed per carrier and do
  not create a runtime representation.
- Acceptable: avoid source-occurrence coalescing by retaining one explicit
  theorem/contract application that relates the two projections, provided its
  owner and complete evidence provenance survive Terminal replay.
- Tempting but wrong: encode `FloatMeaning` as a runtime scalar, compare raw
  float bits, or collapse signed zero merely because NaN payloads erase.
- Tempting but wrong: equate independently authored projections by matching
  operator names, format labels, compact fingerprints, or coincidentally equal
  values without a shared source/contract owner.

## Q2 — Complete Delta v1 type-formation rejection rules

### Context

D17 fixes Delta's type forms, declaration shapes, phase ordering, closed reject
set, and exact source-coordinate principle. The Gamma-written compiler can now
scan every named type against the complete D22/D24 owner census. Several
remaining type-formation cases do not have one exact result in the normative
contract, so implementing them would silently amend Delta v1.

`NAT` admits zero, but `InvalidArrayLength` has no stated triggering set. A
`data` must be exactly a record or sum, but the empty declaration has neither a
fixed classification nor an error coordinate. `never` and views have forbidden
positions, but the contract does not assign every such occurrence to
`TypeMismatch`, `InvalidDataShape`, or `EscapingView`. It also does not settle
ties when an outer forbidden form and a nested unknown or recursive type begin
at the same or competing type-formation coordinates.

### Problem statement

Fix one complete type-formation judgment covering:

1. the admitted array-length set and exact `InvalidArrayLength` coordinate;
2. empty and mixed field/case declarations under `InvalidDataShape`;
3. the exact rejection reason and coordinate for `never` and views in every
   field, payload, parameter, local, array, view, and return position;
4. whether the boundary owner `Console` is a general named capability type or
   is admitted only at the exact `Main.console` boundary position; and
5. deterministic reason selection when multiple type-formation defects share
   the earliest authored coordinate.

### Proposed direction

Admit array lengths `1..INT32_MAX`; reject zero at its literal as
`InvalidArrayLength`. Reject empty or mixed `data` declarations as
`InvalidDataShape` at the declaration name. Use `TypeMismatch` for `never` in
non-return positions and `EscapingView` at the outermost forbidden view token;
an earlier outer placement failure wins over defects nested inside that form.
Treat `Console` as a sealed capability type admitted only for the exact
`Main.console` field fixed by D17, with other placements classified by the
boundary/entry-shape check rather than ordinary nominal type formation.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: admit zero-length arrays, provided `InvalidArrayLength` receives
  another exact, source-reachable definition or is removed in a D17 revision.
- Acceptable: permit an empty record with an explicit zero-initialized meaning,
  provided it cannot also acquire an empty-sum interpretation.
- Acceptable: use one dedicated placement reason for all forbidden `never` and
  view occurrences, provided its coordinates and within-phase priority are
  total.
- Tempting but wrong: infer these results from a host layout, historical
  compiler, likely use by `D`, or whichever recursive check happens to run
  first.

## Q3 — Complete the physical OCREQ/OCOUT v1 tables

### Context

D18 fixes the standalone Omega compiler's logical package subject, invocation,
build evaluation, generated-source custody, and publication model. D25 fixes
the eight-byte `OCREQ` identity, outer subject/invocation lengths and exact end,
the canonical facts each section must carry, the shared `OCOUT` header, and its
sole package/source-coordinate tail. `D` now validates that exact outer request
envelope without interpreting either inner section.

The landed ruling does not enumerate either section's byte order, row
envelopes and widths, numeric variant tags, reserved bytes, or the exact
subject-commitment domain and preimage. It likewise refers to edge-owned
`OCOUT` reason/resource/internal tables, phase order, and scalar provisions
without publishing them. The Rust request object is explicitly
nonauthoritative. Consequently the Delta-written and Omega-written compilers
can satisfy the prose while accepting incompatible byte streams or emitting
incompatible failures.

### Problem statement

Publish one complete version-1 physical profile covering:

1. the exact subject and invocation field order and every row envelope;
2. numeric tags and reserved-byte rules for source lineage, immutable
   resolution, package role, snapshot rows, products, targets, and admissions;
3. exact structural encodings for names, paths, revisions, identities, graph
   indices, dependency aliases, and the selected root;
4. the subject-commitment domain separator, preimage, and 32-byte digest
   placement;
5. closed `OCOUT` Reject, Incomplete, and InternalFailure code/coordinate
   tables plus fixed diagnostic phase precedence; and
6. every named request/compiler scalar provision that can produce
   `Incomplete(limit, requested)`.

### Proposed direction

Publish one normative `ocreq-v1` field table and adjacent closed `ocout-v1`
code/resource tables. Use explicit little-endian length-delimited rows and
zero-based validated graph indices; give every closed sum a fixed numeric tag
and zero reserved bytes. Domain-separate the commitment with a fixed literal
followed by the exact subject-section bytes, not a reconstructed object.
Represent each private capacity as one named scalar resource and order framing,
canonicality, graph, snapshot, admission, commitment, source, build, and later
compiler phases explicitly.

### Alternates

- Acceptable: split subject or invocation into independently versioned nested
  sections, provided the outer D25 exact-end frame remains unchanged and every
  nested identity and extent is canonical.
- Acceptable: choose a different structural identity or commitment preimage,
  provided both compilers can reconstruct it solely from the same request bytes
  and no host/Rust representation participates.
- Tempting but wrong: infer tags from Rust enum order, serialize the current
  Rust request, let `D` define one private layout and `C` another, or postpone
  reason/resource numbers until publication code happens to need them.
