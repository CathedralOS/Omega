# Omega product compiler source

This package is the product root and Terminal-Psi consumer. The
sibling [`../psi/`](../psi/) package owns target-neutral source processing,
checking, and Terminal Psi; this package owns optimization, target realization,
artifact emission, and the product entrypoint.

The product compiler has two exact source implementations. `D` is written in
Delta; `C` is written in Omega using a deliberately conservative,
compositional subset of ordinary Omega.

```text
delta compiler + Delta source D → omega₀
omega₀ + Omega source C          → omega
```

`omega₀` may be conservatively generated and slow. It is already a full Omega
compiler because `D` implements the product language. The second build closes
the self-hosting edge and may improve the compiler executable; it does not add
language functionality.

## Ownership

- [`../psi/`](../psi/) — target-neutral source, proof, and terminal semantics;
- this root — target realization, optimization, artifact emission, the
  Delta-written source closure `D`, and Omega-written source closure `C`;
- [`../omega-rust/`](../omega-rust/) — maintained Rust implementation and
  differential comparator, never bootstrap authority;
- [`../delta/`](../delta/) — final lower-rung compiler and direct first-build
  producer.

That source choice does not define a dialect or restrict programs the resulting
compiler accepts. Standalone viewers, interpreters, REPLs, and proof
explorers remain outside `C` unless the compiler executable imports them.

Implementation work is tracked in [`../../TASKS.md`](../../TASKS.md); bootstrap
closure is tracked in [`../../TASKS_BOOTSTRAP.md`](../../TASKS_BOOTSTRAP.md).
