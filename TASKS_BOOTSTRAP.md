# Bootstrap lattice — active work

Last pruned: 2026-08-24.

This file is the current bootstrap execution queue, not an architecture essay or
changelog. Standing decisions live in
[`wiki/architecture/bootstrap_lattice/decisions.md`](wiki/architecture/bootstrap_lattice/decisions.md),
the two remaining source-surface contracts live in
[`compiler_source_profile.md`](wiki/architecture/bootstrap_lattice/compiler_source_profile.md),
repository ownership lives in
[`repository_structure.md`](wiki/architecture/bootstrap_lattice/repository_structure.md),
and product-compiler implementation work lives in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md).
Completed work and exact historical gate counts remain in Git and beside their
own gates.

Before taking an item, fetch `main`, inspect the newest commits in that lane,
and avoid overlapping another active change. Commit and push coherent
milestones. Engineering difficulty is not a design blocker; mark an item
blocked only when a literal language/profile ruling is required and the
existing decision procedure cannot settle it.

## Settled boundary

```text
Alpha → Beta → Gamma → Delta
Delta bridge source ──[lattice-built Delta compiler]──▶ omega-bootstrap
Ωself product source ──[omega-bootstrap]──────────────▶ omega (full Ω; conservative binary)
Ωself product source ──[optional omega rebuild]───────▶ omega (same compiler; optimized binary)
```

In artifact shorthand this is `Alpha → Beta → Gamma → Delta → omega-bootstrap
→ omega [→ omega]`. Language growth stops at Delta. Everything to its right is
a compiler artifact or a build edge, not another language rung.

Alpha through Delta are increasingly capable bootstrap languages. Production
Omega is more capable still, but it is reached by compiling ordinary Omega
source rather than by defining another bootstrap language between Delta and
Omega.

Only two source inventories are still being selected. They are not successive
Omega editions or two implementations of the same language:

| Surface | Kind | Required closure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Delta v1 | independent robust compiler-host language, C-like in power and Omega-shaped where cheap | the complete Delta source of `omega-bootstrap` plus explicit coherence, robustness, safety, and maintainability arguments |
| `Ωself` | compositional subset of already-valid Omega, with no private meaning | the complete Omega source of production `omega` |

`omega-bootstrap` is written in Delta and need only accept `Ωself`. The
production source is written in `Ωself` but must define a compiler that accepts
full Omega and contains the production optimizer and advanced lowering. A
compiler does not need to use a language feature in order to implement that
feature for its users.

Do not collapse those two source choices into the three artifact obligations:

| Artifact | Must accept | Must contain or produce |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lattice-built Delta compiler | Delta v1 | a correct `omega-bootstrap` executable from the exact Delta bridge closure |
| `omega-bootstrap` | frozen `Ωself` | a semantically exact, possibly conservative production-compiler executable |
| production `omega` | full Omega | the full optimizer, advanced lowering, and specified artifact behavior |

The first production `omega` executable may be slow because of how
`omega-bootstrap` generated it. That does not make its accepted language or
the compiler implementation contained in it partial.

Only the optional bracketed `omega` → `omega` edge is strict self-hosting. It
may improve the compiler executable and add reproducibility evidence, but it is
not a bootstrap dependency, language generation, or second implementation.
There is no omega0, omega1, or Epsilon rung. O0 and O1 are bounded regression
canaries only. Generated-code quality is an artifact property, not a third
source-surface choice.

These standing rulings are not tasks:

- The proof kernel is cross-cutting assurance, with Beta and Gamma
  implementations; Gamma is not the proof-checker rung.
- Direct lower-rooted source-to-artifact refinement grants compiler authority.
  Diverse double compilation (DDC), compiler multiplicity, cross-build
  agreement, and byte agreement are not trust requirements; retain a second
  producer only for measured bug-finding value. See
  [D5](wiki/architecture/bootstrap_lattice/decisions.md#d5--direct-checked-refinement-closes-compiler-provenance).
- The current Rust Psi/Omega compiler stays under the explicitly suffixed
  `bootstrap/onramps/omega-rust/` owner as an optional differential producer.
  `compiler/{psi,omega}/` owns Omega-written product source.
- Standalone Terminal-Psi interpreters, verifiers, REPLs, proof explorers,
  viewers, and debuggers are not in the hosted compiler closure unless the
  compiler executable imports them. Product Terminal-Psi representation and
  lowering modules that it does import remain ordinary source dependencies.
- `omega-bootstrap` may use a direct checked-IR lowering. It need not use
  Terminal Psi internally merely because it compiles product modules that do.

## Delta → omega-bootstrap → production Omega readiness

Delta's compiler-host feasibility, self-host, and bounded bridge canaries exist.
The general `omega-bootstrap`, frozen Delta v1, frozen `Ωself`, and hosted
production build do not. Canaries and D0 are discovery evidence, not numbered
steps toward `Ωself` or definitions of Delta v1.

Two lanes co-evolve until their join:

| Lane | Owner | Bootstrap responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| production compiler source | `OMEGA-PRODUCT-COMPILER-SOURCE` in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) | consume each deterministic checkpoint; derive and measure provisional `Ωself` |
| bridge and language closure | this file | implement general profile rules in Delta; maintain the Delta ledger; freeze both contracts at their completed closures |

Product Psi/Omega implementation and any chosen source refactor stay in
`TASKS.md`. This queue must not turn possible `Ωself` exclusions into separate
proof, generics, domain, field-tag, data-shape, or transition projects. Those
choices stay in the single disposition table in
[`compiler_source_profile.md`](wiki/architecture/bootstrap_lattice/compiler_source_profile.md).
Likewise, this queue does not decide whether full Omega has those features: the
language specification already does. Bootstrap work only prices and implements
the ordinary-Omega forms retained in the compiler's own source profile.

The required execution order is:

1. consume product checkpoints while growing the general bridge;
2. freeze `Ωself` at the complete product-source/bridge join;
3. freeze Delta v1 from the complete bridge source and explicit language
   arguments;
4. build and validate `omega-bootstrap` through the lattice; and
5. perform the one required hosted production build.

The optional product self-rebuild is not part of this queue. Fixed or paged
backing, typed/indexed arenas, bulk reclamation, and conservative lowering are
available bridge implementation choices when they reduce total cost. They do
not become Delta features without specified behavior, lower-rung meaning, and
explicit failure. Maintain that evidence only in
[`bootstrap/rungs/delta/FEATURE_LEDGER.md`](bootstrap/rungs/delta/FEATURE_LEDGER.md).

## Current decision blocker

The visibility rule for private access between distinct logical modules in one
package is unspecified. Until it is ruled, the bridge rejects that case. Public
cross-package access and same-module private access remain unblocked, including
the current two-package nominal-data artifact. No other item below is presently
design-blocked merely because it is large or difficult.

The compilation-authority join is separately waiting on the package/security
owner, not on a bootstrap language ruling. There is not yet a canonical accepted
lock/closure wire, acceptance root, or accepted-lock-to-`OMGCOMP` projection for
the bridge to consume. Continue fixture-driven resolution, checking, lowering,
and refinement while that owner closes `ACCEPTED-LOCK-SCHEMA`; do not invent a
bridge-local receipt and call it authority.

### Rolling invariant — maintain the provisional Delta ledger

At every bridge milestone:

- identify each provisionally used Delta construct's concrete bridge need or
  explicit coherence/safety/robustness rationale;
- record the simpler rejected alternative, exact semantics, resource behavior,
  lower-rung meaning, positive coverage, and nearest excluded form;
- treat D0, samples, and Rust-producer acceptance as evidence only, never as
  admission to Delta v1;
- keep arithmetic, layout, call, allocation, trap, and sealed byte-I/O behavior
  aligned across native targets, the Delta self-host, and the Rust-free
  Delta-to-Gamma meaning route; and
- use the canonical deterministic source bundle without cross-unit token
  fusion or newline-concatenation semantics.

### 1. Consume product checkpoints and enforce provisional `Ωself`

- [ ] For every coherent product-source checkpoint published by
  `OMEGA-PRODUCT-COMPILER-SOURCE` in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md), verify its exact
  deterministic closure and derive or update the distinct compositional
  candidate feature/resource profile. Checkpoint 000001 already supplies the
  first closure and normalized-syntax/resource profile; later compiler phases
  publish later checkpoints from their product owner.
- [ ] Measure every used feature's source benefit against the cost of its
  general Delta-written bridge implementation. Record one provisional outcome:
  retain, refactor from product source and preserve a negative canary, or leave
  unresolved with the exact missing evidence. Absence from a partial checkpoint
  is not a final exclusion.
- [ ] Publish and provisionally enforce compositional syntax, static semantics,
  resources, ABI/layout, and lowering rules. File identities, exact statement
  counts, and enumerated AST permutations are not profile rules.
- [ ] Update the single working feature-disposition table in
  [`compiler_source_profile.md`](wiki/architecture/bootstrap_lattice/compiler_source_profile.md)
  as evidence lands; do not copy that inventory into this task list.
- [ ] Gate the complete checkpoint manifest plus one phase-appropriate negative
  canary for every excluded capability. Separately run the full-Omega product
  suites so an omission from compiler source is never confused with an
  omission from the compiler it implements.

Checkpoint 000001's manifest, normalized census, provisional profile digest,
resource bounds, admission canaries, and mutation teeth are already gated.
Typed semantics, lowering, capacity, and general artifact coverage remain
section-2 work.

Its current resolver replay maps `use` components onto repository files and the
product sources generally omit explicit `module` items. That is exact evidence
about the provisional closure, not authority for legacy filename-derived name
resolution. Before the hosted join, the product owner must publish canonical
logical source placements and source valid under the normative visibility and
import rules. The bridge consumes those placements, requires any authored
module declaration to agree, and must not reproduce the compatibility scanner.

Acceptance for each checkpoint: its exact manifest and separately versioned
candidate-profile evidence reproduce; admitted programs retain exact Omega
meaning; unsupported forms reject; and every unresolved row names the evidence
needed to settle it. The final profile remains unfrozen until the complete
source and bridge join.

### 2. Implement `omega-bootstrap` in Delta

Grow the bridge from checkpoint needs through general capabilities. Do not
recognize the current compiler files, declaration counts, or syntax-tree
permutations.

Current bridge status is intentionally reported by responsibility rather than
as one growing verifier:

| Responsibility | Current closure | Canonical detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| one-unit source/checking/artifact probe | closed for the finite, acyclic, returning `CKIR1`→limited-ELF tranche; not checkpoint closure | [`SOURCE_CUSTODY_FRONTEND_PROBE.md`](bootstrap/omega-bootstrap/compiler/SOURCE_CUSTODY_FRONTEND_PROBE.md), [`OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKED_IR.md`](bootstrap/omega-bootstrap/compiler/OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKED_IR.md) |
| multi-unit structural custody | closed for exact `OMGCOMP`; no resolver/lock or digest authority | [`OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_COMPILATION.md`](bootstrap/omega-bootstrap/compiler/OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_COMPILATION.md) |
| source resolution | closed through canonical `OMGRSW1` for the selected public two-package fixture and exact same-module attached-machine call bindings across source files | [`OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_RESOLUTION.md`](bootstrap/omega-bootstrap/compiler/OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_RESOLUTION.md) |
| resolved-source lowering | closed through canonical CKIR for that fixture | [`OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKED_IR.md`](bootstrap/omega-bootstrap/compiler/OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKED_IR.md) |
| producer composition | closed through the limited ELF backend with exact witness, CKIR, ELF, and result | bridge gates and the contracts above |
| lower-rooted artifact reconstruction | closed for the selected two-package, finite, acyclic, returning artifact through independent persisted-Beta responsibility gates | [`OMGCOMP_REFINEMENT_WITNESS.md`](bootstrap/assurance/refinement/omega-bootstrap/OMGCOMP_REFINEMENT_WITNESS.md) |
| compilation authority | externally gated: canonical accepted-lock projection plus exact envelope SHA-256 still required | compilation and witness contracts above |

None of these bounded closures admits a source family to final `Ωself` or
makes Terminal Psi part of the bridge. Terminal-Psi vocabulary and production
compiler implementation remain product work in `TASKS.md`.

The next actionable bridge work is the versioned call/root slice below, followed
by the remaining capabilities actually used by published product checkpoints.
Do not idle on the separately blocked compilation-authority join.

- [ ] Version the private checked-IR handoff for the next general body tranche.
  Project the exact selected root rather than inferring entry from candidate
  counts, and support typed finite acyclic internal and cross-unit calls from
  the resolver's existing static machine bindings. Carry the change through
  source, witness, checked IR, conservative artifact, result, Rust-free meaning,
  and lower-rooted refinement, with responsibility-local negatives for root,
  target, signature, order, cycle, and resources. This is a versioned bridge
  slice, not admission of recursion or a final `Ωself` ruling.
- [ ] Continue through the remaining general capabilities used by checkpoint
  000001, then later provisional checkpoints, until the bridge generally parses,
  resolves, checks, diagnoses, and conservatively lowers every program admitted
  by candidate `Ωself`. The dedicated versioned-call tranche above owns
  cross-unit calls; transport work alone does not imply that widening.
- [ ] Carry each admitted capability's compositional rules, negative boundary,
  resource teeth, Rust-free meaning, and direct artifact path in the same
  milestone. A bounded frontend-only cost probe is evidence, not bridge
  admission.
- [ ] Publish the complete deterministic Delta source closure of
  `omega-bootstrap`, including every transitive source and build input. Prove
  it valid under the provisional Delta ledger; final validity belongs to the
  Delta-v1 freeze.
- [ ] Once the package/security owner publishes the canonical accepted-lock
  projection, join the structurally checked multi-unit
  [compilation envelope](bootstrap/omega-bootstrap/compiler/OMEGA_BOOTSTRAP_COMPILATION.md)
  to that independently accepted commitment and compare the exact envelope
  SHA-256. Structural validity alone is never compilation authority. This item
  is externally gated; it blocks final acceptance, not the implementation work
  above.

Acceptance: the bridge compiles the complete product-source manifest and every
program admitted by the general candidate profile with exact Omega semantics.
It rejects unsupported Omega before publication. It need not accept full Omega,
optimize its own output, use production allocation machinery, or host unrelated
product tools. The product optimizer and advanced lowering remain ordinary
modules in that manifest; they are compiled into the resulting production
compiler rather than reimplemented inside the bridge.

Implementation may advance independently across transport, authority,
resolution, checking/lowering, and artifact-refinement seams when their byte
contracts are fixed. Acceptance joins all of them; progress in one seam must
not be reported as authority for another.

### 3. Freeze `Ωself` at the completed bridge join

- [ ] Reconcile the final deterministic product source closure, provisional
  compositional profile, and complete bridge implementation. For every
  disputed Omega source feature, retain it with its measured implementation and
  assurance cost discharged or refactor it out and preserve a negative canary.
  Freeze all transitive build inputs under the same rules.

Acceptance: every row is retained or excluded; every retained form has general
parsing, checking, meaning, lowering, resources, and negative-boundary coverage;
and the exact product source closes under those rules. This profile governs
what `omega-bootstrap` accepts, not which full-Omega features the resulting
compiler implements.

### 4. Freeze Delta v1

- [ ] Classify every retained construct as required by the complete bridge
  closure or justified by an explicit coherence, robustness, safety, or
  maintainability argument. Remove accidental D0, corpus, and Rust-producer
  behavior.
- [ ] Publish versioned normative grammar, static and dynamic semantics,
  representation/ABI, source-bundle, resource, and sealed-host-interface
  contracts under `bootstrap/rungs/delta/`.
- [ ] Reject every excluded source, type, module, boundary, and resource form
  explicitly.
- [ ] Publish a classified conformance corpus and feature manifest with positive
  observations, phase-isolated negatives, exhaustion teeth, cross-target
  layout/arithmetic edges, and native/self-host/lower-rung differentials.
  Differential agreement is bug-finding evidence, not artifact authority.
- [ ] Prove the complete deterministic `omega-bootstrap` source closure valid
  under the frozen contract.

Acceptance: Delta v1 is a coherent, robust, independently specified
compiler-host language sufficient for the complete bridge—not a whitelist of
that bridge's current tokens. Later widening is an explicit versioned language
change.

### 5. Validate Delta → `omega-bootstrap`

- [ ] Build the exact bridge artifact through the canonical lattice path and
  join its Delta source closure, produced artifact, canonical meaning, and
  independently reconstructed lower-rooted source-to-artifact refinement in one
  gate. Exercise profile-wide compositional positives, excluded-feature
  diagnostics, exhaustion, deterministic publication, conservative lowering,
  and relevant proof/translation-validation seams. Rust-built or self-host
  agreement may remain differential evidence but cannot substitute for the
  join.

Acceptance: the exact lattice-built bridge is bound to its exact source and
meaning, needs no Rust producer or ambient assembler/linker in the required
path, and correctly accepts and rejects the frozen `Ωself` profile.

### 6. Perform the sole required hosted production build

- [ ] Run the validated Delta-built bridge on the exact frozen `Ωself`
  manifest. Validate the resulting compiler against canonical meaning, the
  full compiler and language suites, and the applicable artifact-refinement
  seams.

Acceptance: the produced compiler accepts full Omega and contains the product
optimizer and advanced lowering, although its own executable may have been
generated conservatively. This closes the required lattice. A later
`omega` → `omega` rebuild is optional product optimization and reproducibility
work.

## Gate and performance discipline

- Keep one focused gate per active capability; run the full lattice gate only
  at coherent milestones.
- Give transport decoding, semantic resolution, checked-IR validation, artifact
  reconstruction, and orchestration separate modules/checkers. Compose them by
  versioned artifacts and cross-pair tests; do not grow one verifier through a
  Cartesian product of source and artifact permutations.
- Put shared fixture generation and corpus registration in small harnesses.
  Keep positive, negative, resource, and target families in responsibility-
  specific files so adding a case does not recompile an unrelated monolith.
- A gate approaching tens of minutes must report subgate timings before more
  feature growth. Profile compiler, evaluator, and harness separately.
- Keep one compilation single-threaded until profiling justifies compiler
  concurrency. Parallelize independent fixture compiles first.
- Exhaustive native matrices may be paired with a small representative
  self-built/lower-rung matrix when the latter is semantically redundant and
  disproportionately slow; document the coverage split.
- Debug HTML, viewers, exhaustive dumps, and other human-only artifacts are
  opt-in. Default gates emit only checker-consumed evidence and concise failure
  diagnostics.
- Paged arenas, parallel lowering, advanced optimization, and incremental
  compilation are permitted performance work, not prerequisites for Delta or
  `omega-bootstrap`.
